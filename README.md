# Practice JavaScript Challenges 

We have 22 challenges for you to complete as part of your prep work. 

To ensure you are ready for day one of training, feel confident in fundamentals of JavaScript and with GitHub, we have presented the  challenges as assignment through [GitHub Classroom](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/get-started-with-github-classroom/about-github-classroom). This allows us to check your work, give feedback and any assistance before you starting the training. 

## How to start 
You will learn about how to use GitHub during the training, so to complete these 22 challenges you will need to use and external free code editor like, [Replit](https://replit.com/) or [Programiz ](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/) or the JS file in Codepen (which are also three online) or you can use VSCode (which you will need to have downloaded as part of the environment setup).

Below you will find three repositories of the challenges in JavaScript files. 

1. 10 [Very Easy Challenges](veryEasyChallenges/veryEasyChallenges.js)
2. 10 [Easy Challenges](easyChallenges/easyChallenges.js)
3. 2 [Harder Challenges](harderChallenges/harderChallenges.js)

We have added the [Very Easy Challenges](https://replit.com/@la-fosse-academy/Very-Easy-Challenges) and [Easy Challenges](https://replit.com/@la-fosse-academy/Easy-Challenges) to Replit, however these could be unavailable to you due to plans or development time, so you will need to use another code editor. 

### Completing using an online Code Editor
To complete the challenges, you will need to copy the code from the respository on GitHub to a code editor, and copy back the solution into the original repository on GitHub. When you have successfully completed all the challenges and copied them over, all the tests should pass. 

#### View the Loom video below on how to copy your challenges over to a code editor and commit back to your GitHub repository. 
For Replit, the challenges are already copied over in the links, and you only need to copy your solutions back to GitHub.

You can use Google and your notes to help you, however we do not except the use of ChatGBT, as ChatGBT is not useful for your own development. We recommend [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to review JavaScript documentation, which can be used to help solve these challenges.

### View the Loom video below on how to use GitHub Codespaces in VSCode
We advise using an external code editor, however if you feel confident in VSCode, you might want to try working with GitHub Codespaces.

## How to run the tests and complete the assignment
The aim is pass all the tests in the assignments. There are three test suites for each file: Very Easy Challenges; Easy Challenges; Harder Challenges, and you will be awarded 10 points for each file passing.

View the video below to check that your tests are passing.

## Help
By the end of completing these challenges, you should feel confident in creating different data type variables, defining a function, and using basic array in-built functions.
